Install growl:
http://growl.info/downloads.php

with the image still mounted from a terminal, run:
cd /Volumes/Growl\ 1.1.1/Extras/growlnotify/
sudo install.sh

copy opLogger somewhere and set cachefile to something appropriate

set up a launchd entry:

create a file ~/Library/LaunchAgents/net.home.oplog.[username].plist
replace [username] with your username

with the contents:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN"
"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
       <key>Label</key>
       <string>net.home.oplog.[username]</string>
       <key>UserName</key>
       <string>[username]</string>
       <key>ProgramArguments</key>
       <array>
               <string>/path/to/opLogger</string>
       </array>
       <key>StartInterval</key>
       <integer>60</integer>
</dict>
</plist>

replacing [username] with your username and /path/to/opLogger
you can also modify the time between runs by changing the <integer>

run:
launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/net.home.oplog.[username].plist
replace [username] with your username

You should see a registration message the first time it fires off.

To test the rest, you can de-increment the number in the cache file after the first time it runs to generate messages.
